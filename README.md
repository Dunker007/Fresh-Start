# Fresh Start - LuxRig Content Engine

**Status:** Foundation Phase  
**Architecture:** Rix (The Vibe Coder) + Opus 4.1 Strategic Roadmap  
**Stack:** bolt.diy | LM Studio | LuxRig (Windows 11)

---

## Mission Statement

Build ONE working revenue stream: **Content Generation → Blog Publishing → AdSense Revenue**

Stop building wide. Start building deep.

---

## Project Philosophy

This is not The Kingdom v2. This is a focused, surgical strike at passive income using our existing infrastructure. 

**The Kingdom = Scrapyard** (110 modules, some gems, lots of rust)  
**Fresh Start = Focused Build** (10 modules, all money-making)

---

## The Stack

- **LM Studio**: Local AI generation (no API costs)
- **bolt.diy**: Framework architecture (proven patterns)
- **LuxRig**: Windows 11 home server (24/7 operation)
- **PowerShell**: Orchestration language (native Windows)

---

## Current Status

🏗️ **Foundation Phase**
- [x] Project structure created
- [ ] Git initialized and connected to GitHub
- [ ] Core configuration files
- [ ] Expanded 10-phase roadmap
- [ ] Boneyard inventory (Kingdom salvage assessment)

4. **Phase 6**: Automation & Scheduling - 24/7 operation

### Revenue Layer
4. **Phase 4**: Revenue Integration - AdSense + affiliates

### Production Hardening
5. **Phase 7**: Quality & Testing - Reliability assurance
6. **Phase 10**: Production Hardening - Security & monitoring

### Enhancement Layers

8. **Phase 8**: Analytics & Optimization - Performance tracking
9. **Phase 9**: Expansion Features - Second revenue stream

**Local**: `C:\Repos GIT\Fresh-Start`

## The Reality

This assumes:
- LM Studio is configured and running
- We have a publishing target (blog/website)
- Content quality is sufficient for SEO
- We can dedicate ~30 hours to implementation

This does NOT include:
- Crypto trading (separate system)
- Multiple AI providers (unnecessary complexity)
- Product building (different project)
- API monetization (requires customers)

---

**Built with focus. Shipped with intent. Scaled with data.**
